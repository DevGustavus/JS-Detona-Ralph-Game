## ðŸ“– About the project
Project developed as part of a code/project challenge at DIO, as part of the BootCamp: "PotÃªncia Tech iFood - Game Development." The project's main objective was to build a small engine for a simple click-based game. Key factors in the project included the construction of standard functions based on a fixed model of operation (engine), which consisted of three main fields: actions, values, and views. The game's theme was inspired by Disney's "Wreck-It Ralph."
